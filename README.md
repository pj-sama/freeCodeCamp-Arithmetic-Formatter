# Arithmetic Formatter

This is a task available on [freeCodeCamp]() as part of the [Scientific Computing with Python]() course.

This program takes a list of strings that are arithmetic problems and returns the problems arranged vertically and side-by-side.
Similar to how one would write sums using the column method.
