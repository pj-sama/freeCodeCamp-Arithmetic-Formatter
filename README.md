# Arithmetic Formatter

This is a task available on [freeCodeCamp](https://www.freecodecamp.org/) as part of the [Scientific Computing with Python](https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/scientific-computing-with-python) course.

This program takes a list of strings that are arithmetic problems and returns the problems arranged vertically and side-by-side.
Similar to how one would write sums using the column method.
